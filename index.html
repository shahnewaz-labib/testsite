        <h1>Nuclear energy</h1>
        <p>Nuclear energy is the energy in the nucleus, or core, of an atom.
        Atoms are tiny units that make up all matter in the universe,
        and energy is what holds the nucleus together. There is a huge amount of
        energy in a atom's dense nucleus.</p>
