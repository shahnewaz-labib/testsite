        <p class="paragraph">Nuclear power is the use of nuclear reactions to produce electricity.
        Nuclear power can be obtained from nuclear fission, nuclear decay and nuclear fusion reactions. 
        Presently, the vast majority of electricity from nuclear power is produced by nuclear fission of uranium and plutonium in nuclear power plants.
        Nuclear decay processes are used in niche applications such as radioisotope thermoelectric generators in 
        some space probes such as Voyager 2.
        Generating electricity from fusion power remains the focus of international research.
